# RSPortfolioSite

Richard Sep≈°i - personal portfolio website. Made to show my work in one place.

Created with plain JS, CSS and HTML. Can be ran locally from file or on a locally hosted server. Search function will not work unless ran on a live server.
Website doesn't collect any user data and only saves language preferences into cookies.

Please report all bugs, problems and typos by opening an issue here on github: https://github.com/RichardSepsi/RSPortfolioSite/issues/new

Notes:
    languageselector.js line 63 : TEMPORARY : Fix for languages not switching on live deployed version
